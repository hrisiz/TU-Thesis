   A DHCP client for linux 2.6, using modern kernel features, (c) 2006,
   2007 Stefan Rompf.

Motivation

   Using a notebook, I'm often traveling between different networks.
   After replugging, I always needed to issue a ifdown/ifup sequence
   because the DHCP client did not realize the temporary disconnection.
   This is an unneeded limitation because since 2.6, the kernel notifies
   userspace of these disconnection/reconnection events. Actually is was
   me who implemented this feature.

   Beginning with 2.6.17, the linux kernel will allow userspace to
   influence this signalling, so that for example a wpa supplicant can
   tell the dhcpclient that an association has finished and the client
   should try to get an IP address. wpa_supplicant supports this starting
   with version 0.5.3.


   Of course, you need software that supports this feature. Unfortunately,
   most existing DHCP clients implemented their statemachine using
   siglongjmp() or one huge function, so there was no easy way to extend
   them. So I wrote a new one.

Features

     * RFC2131 compatible DHCP client, tested with ISC dhcpd directly and
       via a Cisco IOS relay agent, Cisco IOS DHCP server and dnsmasq.
     * uses netlink for interface configuration
     * does act on link state messages
     * calls a script on every state change to allow updating resolv.conf
       etc
     * small, compiles with [1]uclibc
     * Follows RFC4436 to speed up reconnects


Status

   Currently, this is alpha software. It shouldn't be used in production
   environment, but I'm looking forward for people who like to test it in
   different environments and for (reasonable ;-) feature suggestions!

Todo

   [BUG] dhcpclient fails to notice lease expiry when laptop wakes up from
       suspend and card does not send carrier down/up events via netlink.
   [FEATURE] Restore default gateway on lease expiry when invoked without -G
       and the default gateway was on another interface.
   [WISH] Request additional options via command line arguments.
   [WISH] Pass all dhcp options to script (according to type).
   [FEATURE] Pass -G (or all) command line options to script (it is currently
       not possible for the script to find out whether to modifiy resolv.conf
       or not regarding command line arguments.
