snap_20071104
=============
-don't require asm/unaligned.h anymore
-fixed some netlink parsing bugs spotted by Thomas Graf
-handle providers sending a default gateway outside local subnet
-documentation and script updates by Jörg Mayer

snap_20061009
=============
-signedness fixes (thanks to Jörg Mayer)
-fix struct timeval overflow, this also enables handling
 of infinite lease time
-close pid-fd when starting script, use correct macro
 for fcntl()-argument
-add syslog support (only enabled by adding -DUSE_SYSLOG to
 Makefile, as this feature increases working set by >200k
 with glibc)
-added DESTDIR support and .spec-File (thanks to Jörg Mayer) 

snap_20060328
=============
-add the relevant RFCs as comments to the options
 (thanks to Jörg Mayer)
-fix backoff during RENEWING/REBINDING
-default T2 is .875*LEASE, not .85. By the way avoid floating
 point ops in T1/T2 calculation
-set and verify UDP checksum (thanks to Jörg Mayer, with
 changes) 
-send DHCPCLIENT_VERSION as DHCP_VERSION to script 
-script updates (thanks to Jörg Mayer)
-support for DHCP_OPTION_OVERLOAD (thanks to Jörg Mayer,
 with changes)
-MANUAL update (thanks to Jörg Mayer)
-write pidfile, ensuring that daemon is started only once
 per interface
-make sure that the script is also called when the interface
 is put admin down or removed.

snap_20060309
=============
-script updates (thanks to Jörg Mayer)
-configure default gateway only when it is really sent
-send DHCP_OPTION_OPTIONREQ, DHCP_OPTION_LEASE and
 BOOTP_OPTION_HOSTNAME only when allowed by RFC2131
-send list of requested parameters (DHCP_OPTION_OPTIONREQ)
-environment for current config sent to script is prefixed
 with DHCP_CURRENT_ instead of DHCP_
-send ARP probe to default gateway as unicast when possible

snap_20060301
=============
-DHCP_OPTION_SERVER overwrote BOOTP_OPTION_NETMASK, leading
 to funny but wrong netmasks when server sent both options,
 netmask first
-add offered config and, when going to state BOUND, previous
 config to script environment

snap_20060227
=============
-set T1 as timeout after arp checking the default gateway

snap_20060226
=============
-After a oper down/up transition, try to verify the default
 gateway via ARP requests before falling back to INIT_REBOOT.
 Number of queries can be configured with -A, default is 3
 (suggested by Simon Barber)
-Man page fixes (thanks to Jörg Mayer) 

snap_20060223
=============
-make number of ARP queries (-a) configurable.
 (Thanks to Jörg Mayer)
-fix (non-critical) off-by-one bug in message parsing
-check hostname and domainname sent from DHCP server to script
 for validity
-added sample dhcpclient-script (thanks to Jörg Mayer,
 Maurice Massar)
-Many Makefile updates (thanks to Jörg Mayer) 
-Set IP address and default gateway only if configuration
 offered by server changed to improve interoperability
 with f.e. VPN software that changes routes
-SIGHUP goes to INIT_REBOOT. REBIND is not agressive enough
 if a user really wants to verify the configuration

snap_20060219
=============
-man page (Thanks to Jörg Mayer)
-decline requested address if it is in use, detected by ARP
 query. Can be disabled with -a

snap_20060217_2
===============
-check return code when setting sockets to close on exec
-fixup includes for ntohs() and friends
 (Thanks to Paul Collins, Stefan Schmidt)
-don't rely on include provided inline inet_mask_len() because
 it doesn't compile on some platforms

snap_20060217
=============
-Initial public release
