Installation instructions
=========================

Requirements:

-Linux kernel 2.6.x
-GNU make
-gcc, tested with 3.3.5 or higher
-makedepend


Compilation:

Edit Makefile if you want to change the installation location (default:
/usr/local). Then type make in the base directory. This will create a .depend
file and compile the executable.  


Installation:

Type "make install", then modify /usr/local/sbin/dhcpclient-script.sample
and move it to /usr/local/sbin/dhcpclient-script


Running:

Bring up the interface without assigning an address by typing
"ifconfig <interfacename> up".

Start /usr/local/sbin/dhcpclient <interfacename>. If you run the executable
without any argument, it will print the options available. Most interesting
might be -c that takes the path to a script that will be executed on every
state change and can be used f.e. to change resolv.conf. -c defaults to
/usr/local/sbin/dhcpclient-script.


Suse 9.3:

With some script magic, dhcpclient can be setup as the default dhcp client
for Suse 9.3:
-Write a short script that execs dhcpclient for a specific interface and
 with options of your choice
-enter the string "DHCLIENT_BIN=<path to your script>" into
 /etc/sysconfig.d/network/ifcfg-<interface>

The provided client sample script can take care of updating resolv.conf by
running /sbin/modify_resolvconf.


Troubleshooting:

If the client doesn't refresh/change the IP adress when moving to a new
network, check if your network card supports link state notification. "ip
monitor" should print events whenever you plug or unplug the cable. If it
doesn't, your network card driver does not support the feature.
